# Lane Detection with YOLOv7 
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project combines YOLOv7 (for object detection) and computer vision techniques to detect lanes, pedestrians, and vehicles in real-time. It supports multiple track shapes (circular, custom paths) and includes Region of Interest (ROI) filtering for optimized processing.

Key Features  
âœ” Lane Detection â€“ Using perspective transforms, binarization, and sliding window techniques.  
âœ” Object Detection â€“ YOLOv7 detects pedestrians and vehicles within lanes.  
âœ” Multiple Track Support â€“ Pre-configured launch files for different track shapes (circular, custom, etc.).  
âœ” ROI Filtering â€“ Focuses processing only on relevant road regions.  
âœ” ROS Integration â€“ Works with Robot Operating System for real-time control.
